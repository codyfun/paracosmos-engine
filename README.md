# Credits
This prototype borrows a lot of gameplay elements from [TROUBLESHOOTER: Abandoned Children](https://store.steampowered.com/app/470310/TROUBLESHOOTER_Abandoned_Children/) (Copyright of Dandylion) and [Epic Battle Fantasy 5](https://store.steampowered.com/app/432350/Epic_Battle_Fantasy_5/) (Copyright of Matt Roszak). I make no guarantee that any of them will survive to future iterations of this project.
